Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning
This project performs sentiment analysis on textual data using various machine learning techniques. It classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment using models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and others.

📘 Overview
Goal: To build and evaluate models that can accurately predict the sentiment of a given text.

Data: Text dataset (possibly from Kaggle or other open-source platforms).

Techniques Used:

Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization)

Feature extraction using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer

Machine Learning models

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
